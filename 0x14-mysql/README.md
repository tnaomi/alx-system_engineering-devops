## Tasks

### 0. Install MySQL

First things first, letâ€™s get MySQL installed on both your ``web-01`` and ``web-02`` servers.

- MySQL distribution must be ``5.7.x``
- Make sure that task #3 of your SSH psudo mysqlsudoroject is completed for ``web-01`` and ``web-02``. The checker will connect to your servers to check MySQL status
- Please make sure you have your ``README.md`` pushed to GitHub.

### 1. Let us in!

In order for us to verify that your servers are properly configured, we need you to create a user and password for both MySQL databases which will allow the checker access to them.

- Create a MySQL user named ``holberton_user`` on both ``web-01`` and ``web-02`` with the ``host`` name set to ``localhost`` and the ``password`` ``projectcorrection280hbtn``. This will allow us to access the replication status on both servers.
- Make sure that ``holberton_user`` has permission to check the primary/replica status of your databases.
- In addition to that, make sure that task #3 of your SSH project is completed for ``web-01`` and ``web-02``. You will likely need to add the public key to ``web-02`` as you only added it to ``web-01`` for this project. The checker will connect to your servers to check MySQL status
